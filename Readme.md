# ⚠️ Issues

### Minecraft lagging when using datapacks
> I have no idea
~Because Minecraft have a very bad garbage collector, to fix that issues you will need optifine installed and run a paper server so you can run the datapack without any lag (Run a server with a minimum of 6GB on a server/local pc)~
